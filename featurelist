nubernel-2.6.32_v1.0.1.

Includes a custom "Nubernel the kernel" bootlogo.
Allows for battery charging values to be tweaked via the "Nubernel Battery Tweaker" app (available in the market).
Ensures su is installed properly.
Ensures superuser is installed properly.
Ensures busybox is installed properly.
Installs bash into /system/bin/ (if it is not found).
Includes flash tools (redbend_ua and bmlwrite) in /sbin.
Includes custom scripts in /vendor/bin.
Supports the following:
  bootanimation.zip, init.d scripts, RFS, EXT4, CIFS, TUN, Netfilter TCPMSS.
Fully supports VoltageControl and SetCPU.
Uses deadline as the default I/O scheduler.
Includes the following I/O schedulers:
  noop, anticipatory, deadline, cfq, bfq.
Includes the following CPU frequencies:
  100MHz, 200MHz, 400MHz, 600MHz, 800MHz, 900MHz, 1000MHz, 1120MHz, 1200MHz, 1300MHz, 1400MHz.
Disables the following CPU frequencies by default (use an app or sysfs to enable them):
  100MHz, 1200MHz, 1300MHz, 1400MHz.
Includes the following CPU governors (see notes below):
  smartass, interactiveX, interactive, conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, transitional, performance.
  CPU governor notes:
    The included conservative governor is the original version of the conservative governor (not Samsung's modified version you have been used to).
    The interactiveX governor is a varient of the interactive governor that includes sleep profiling.
    The transitional governor is Samsung's modified version of the conservative governor, renamed.
    The transitional governor is the default and recommended governor.
Uses transitional as the default CPU governor.
Includes a custom written cpu frequency selector function, an attempt to fix some of the problems with the various available governors.
Loads the Android logger as a module.
